# Digital Transformation on a Small Start-Up Enterprise: Design, Prototype, and Deployment Based on Human-Centered Design Principles for the Construction Sector

## Abstract
Logistics with real-time management of work activities at a construction site, including building materials and human resources, is an innovation for micro and small enterprises starting up in the construction sector. Enterprises of this size are being run using traditional turn-of-the-century technology tools, namely, excel spreadsheets as data storage. This paper presents a case study of technology implementation at a startup enterprise in the Belgian construction sector between 2018 and mid-2020, and discusses the challenges needed to overcome during the period of digital transformation. A multi-environment logistics platform was designed and prototyped following human-centered design principles enabling the enterprise to move forward and improve work methodologies to work with real-time data. Results after 18 months demonstrated an increased efficiency in all work processes, with a reduction of losses in all aspects of work activities and improved control of production estimates and measurements

**A final statement about Mental Health in Science**<br>
It is found recurrently on the internet news and comments about another scientific researcher, in particular junior and medior researchers, going through some kind of mental health difficulties in particular those associated with sensory overload events. Promoted by abusive usage of wireless devices, assembled or modified to actuate at a distance and invisible, causing harm to a victim’s neurobiology. This is an old area of knowledge, that now needs to be openly discussed and commented, in a peaceful constructive way towards identification of solutions to all abusive usages of wireless frequency waves (radiation or vibration) in electronic devices. Open solutions are the correct path toward safety in usage of all things related to such technologies. Be knowledgeable to stay safe.

# Business Technology Implementation

Between 2018 and mid-2020, I successfully implemented a digital transformation to a startup in the construction sector and moved the enterprise forward by enabling the delivery of works to all 70+ construction workers, with the implementation of digital methodologies and communication in real time at each construction site and at the same time managing all logistics aspects of construction works through a cloud logistics platform, also designed from start by me, developed, and coded. Currently consists of 2 android Apps, an MS Windows desktop App in.NETCore. All connecting to a cloud server API and where data is stored and shared among devices using current encryption standards. 

The current state of development allows remote human resource management using a location-sensitive attendance log system where the worker, at the construction site, uses his company smartcard, union card, or smartphone to register entrance and exit the perimeter of the construction site. It is also possible to document all construction building materials delivered at each construction site: each time a truck arrives at the site, a designated worker opens an entry in the system and adds a photocopy of the delivery document for the materials that are being unloaded. 
You can download a testing version of the software at

**Brief summary of what solutions were prototyped and deployed: ( P. & D. )**

■ Health & Safety
I proposed the implementation of mandatory usage of an OEM smartwatch at a construction site to all construction workers.

■ Improve response time and communication 
 Implemented a communication chat with photos and video sharing, between office workers and workers at a construction site using the well-known Slack Messaging Mobile App. Remote managing and drastically lowered response time on issues, occurrences, and problems encountered by workers: from bad planning to detection of project errors during the execution phase. 

■ Management of workers' attendance
P&D a cloud database for management of attendance at a construction site, using NFC smartcards handed to each construction worker with a photo ID and work category. 

■ Remote Management of work tasks 
P&D a Logging of extra hours of work not stated on the initial contract

■ P&D a remote Management of building materials stocks, tools, and machinery at the construction site. Documental Logging of all delivery notes from building materials delivered at the construction site

■ Technologies: Visual Studio VB.NET, Android Studio SDK 28, PHP 7.x , HTML 5, CSS 3, MySQL 5.x, AES 128bit encryption, Cloud ReST API, Development & Deployment using AGILE.
