And when I let go of ALL experiences, there is just this moment, exactly as it is. And that is more than enough... -Michael Jeffries

Life is luck, make it. Life is life, fight for it!   -Mother Teresa

The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work & his play, his labor & his leisure, his mind and his body, his information & his recreation, his love & his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he’s always doing both.  -Judah Isvaran
The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for. -Maureen Dowd

Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.  -Yoda from Star Wars

Only to the white man was nature a wilderness and only to him was the land infested with wild animals and savage people. To us, it was tame. Earth was bountiful and we were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery. Not until the hairy man from the east came and with brutal frenzy heaped injustices upon us and the families we loved was it wild for us. When the very animals of the forest began fleeing from his approach, then it was for us that the wild west began. -Luther Standing Bear, Chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (1868-1939) Land of the Spotted Eagle, 1933
Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.

I'll tell you a secret. Something they don't teach you in your temple. The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last.

Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it - Andre Gide
Don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum.  -Baz Luhrmann
My heart, oh my heart. Don’t become discouraged so easily. Have faith in the hidden world; there are many mysteries, many wonders. Even if the whole planet threatens your life, don’t let go of the beloveds robe for even a breath. -Rumi
Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with others. -Chogyam Trungpa, Shambhala
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. -Marianne Williamson
For most of history, Anonymous was a woman. -Virgina Wolfe
You are what you eat.
Know the masculine. Keep to the feminine. - Lao Tzu
The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. -Morpheus, 'The Matrix'
We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world. — Terence McKenna
A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up. -Mae West

A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. -Martin Luther King Jr.

In the very end, civilizations perish because they listen to their politicians and not to their poets. -Jonas Mekas
Let us declare nature to be legitimate. All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter. The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous.
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing...there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase each other doesn't make any sense. -Rumi
If you want to know your past life, look into your present condition; if you want to know your future life, look at your present actions. I am present in front of anyone who has faith in me, just as the moon casts its reflection, effortlessly, in any vessel filled with water. -Orgyen Guru Rinpoche
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience. -Ralph Waldo Emerson
Oz never did give nothin' to the Tinman that he didn't already have.

I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. -Maya Angelou
Worry is a complete cycle of inefficient thought revolving about a pivot of fear. 
Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been. -Marcus Aurelius
I wanted a perfect ending. Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity. -Gilda Radner
If you know who you are & let your love shine through, then you'll find the life you need & it'll find you. 
When there is no wind... row. 
A man would do nothing if he waited until he could do it so well that no one could find fault. - John Henry Newman

And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. - Anaïs Nin 
Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it ...and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness. -Robertson Davies
You'll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. You'll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that Life's a Great Balancing Act. -Dr. Suess 
No explanation, no mix of words, or music, or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world, whatever it meant. There was madness in any direction. At any hour you could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle, that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense, we didn’t need that, our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum. We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later you can go on a steep hill in Los Vegas and look west. And with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark, that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. -Hunter S. Thompson
 Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy. -Eckhart Tolle
It is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be sometimes cheated than not to trust. - Samuel Johnson
It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed. -Ram Dass

Frequently consider the connection of all things in the Universe. ... Reflect upon the multitude of bodily and mental events taking place in the same brief time, simultaneously in every one of us and so you will not be surprised that many more events, or rather all things that come to pass, exist simultaneously in the one and entire unity, which we call the Universe. ... We should not say ‘I am an Athenian’ or ‘I am a Roman’ but ‘I am a Citizen of the Universe'. -Marcus Aurelius, 170AD 
You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfoldingas it should. - Max Ehrmann

The sun never says to the earth,'You owe me.' Look what happens with a love like that. It lights up the whole sky.  - Hafiz
'Turn on' meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. 'Tune in' meant interact harmoniously with the world around you—externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. Drop out suggested an elective, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. 'Drop Out' meant self-reliance, a discovery of one's singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean 'Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity.' —Timothy Leary, Flashbacks, 1983
LSD burst over the dreary domain of the constipated bourgeoisie like the angelic herald of a new psychedelic millennium. We have never been the same since, nor will we ever be, for LSD demonstrated, even to skeptics, that the mansions of heaven and gardens of paradise lie within each and all of us. -Terence Mckenna

Our world is like a boomerang. If we throw anger, anger comes back; if we throw... love, love comes back. If we throw negativity, negativity comes back; if we throw positivity, positivity comes back. -Positively Positive
In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself.  - Jiddu Krishnamurti

Any problem in the world can be solved by dancing.  -James Brown 
This is a time of growth and change. Trust what is occurring. Your doubts will only make the process more painful. Surrender to the flow, relax, and have fun with it. You are experiencing a rebirth, and that is intense, but it does not have to be painful. Refuse to believe anyone who tells you otherwise. You can handle this, and you can make it fun. Decide to make it fun. - Dorothy Mendoza Row
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. -Rumi

And the day came when the risk it took to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. - Anais Nin
I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself. - Maya Angelou
Love is what we are born with. Fear is what we learn. The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and prejudices and the acceptance of love back in our hearts. Love is the essential reality and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life. Meaning does not lie in things. Meaning lies in us. - Marianne Williamson
Whether you like it or not it's raining now. It shouldn't be raining is just a thought.  In reality there is no such thing as should or shouldn't.  These are only thoughts that we impose on reality. - Byron Katie

Who would you be without your should or shouldn't?  -Byron Katie
I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.

Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. - Calvin Coolidge 
Before you put on a frown, make absolutely sure there are no smiles available.  -Jim Beggs
  We must not allow other people's limited perceptions to define us   -Virginia Satir

If I can teach my daughter one thing, it will be the love of self unconditionally.' Unconditional love and peace are obtainable, but they are only obtainable if I can learn to move beyond the conditions that I placed on my life. When conditions are placed on my life and on the lives of others, they ensure that I will never experience the depths of love and happiness. Dr. Asa Don Brown, Waiting to Live
  I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.   - Martin Luther King Jr.
While I am worrying about what you think of me I am not open to you, I am not letting you in; in fact, I am not letting you exist as a person - I am making you my mirror. I choose to use my own mind.

I believe that everything happens for a reason.
